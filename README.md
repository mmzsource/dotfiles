# Goal

Attempt to organise my dotfiles and keep them in sync over multiple
computers.

# Usage

Clone this repo wherever you like (I use `~/.dotfiles`), install [GNU
`stow`][], and run the `install.sh` script. That'll set up a bunch of
symlinks in your home directory, e.g., `~/.bashrc` â†’
`~/.dotfiles/bash/.bashrc`.

[GNU `stow`]: https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/

It won't overwrite existing files, so move those out of the way
first.

# Licence

Use everything in this repo however you want it at your own risk.
